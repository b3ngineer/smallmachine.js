# smallmachine.js #

_Smallmachine.js_ infers object models from terms and rules.  Collections of terms and rules&mdash;called ontologies&mdash;are organized by namespaces and across domains.  Additionally, _smallmachine.js_ ontologies can also provide activators, which are bindings for handlers that get attached to assembled object models on their way out the door.

The catalyst for building _smallmachine.js_ was a desire to better organize and capitalize on the custom event types and patterns that span libraries, toolkits and frameworks&mdash;third party and homegrown.  _Smallmachine.js_ mimics semantic data standards to benefit from emerging linked data conventions.  Additional patterns that work well in Javascript, such as mixins and partially applied functions, fill in the rest of the framework.

At the moment, _smallmachine.js_ is evolving into something more flexible than just a powerful, combinative event model.  Because of this fact, it's impossible to keep up with documentation during this phase of continuous development.  Documentation will eventually become part of smallmachinejs.org.
