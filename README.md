# smallmachine.js #
---
_Smallmachine.js_ builds object models from terms and rules.  Collections of terms and rules&mdash;called ontologies&mdash;are organized by namespaces.  _Smallmachine.js_ ontologies can also provide activators, which are bindings for handlers that get attached to assembled object models on the way out the door.

The catalyst for building _smallmachine.js_ was/is a desire to better organize the custom event names across libraries, toolkits and frameworks that get reused when building Javascript applications (professionally or otherwise).  _Smallmachine.js_ mimics semantic data standards to capitalize on emerging linked data conventions.  Additional patterns that work well in Javascript, such as mixins and partially applied functions, fill in the rest of the framework.

At the moment, _smallmachine.js_ is emerging into something far more flexible than just a powerful, common event model.  Because of this fact, it's impossible to keep up with documentation during this phase of continuous development.  Documentation will eventually become part of smallmachinjs.org.
